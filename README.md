# The Weather Here

- Weather Here App is a web application that enables users to view real time weather and air quality data from their current location as well as timestamped data from places other users have visited through an interactive map using Leaflet
- Implemented an API with Node.js, Express.js and a NeDB data store to fetch weather and air data from 3rd party APIs, store it in the database, and return data to the frontend
