- The Weather Here application tracks the user's loaction (lat & lon) and sends it to it's API 
- To get the specific data the API sends the user's location to three different API's.
  One for weather, second for the air quality and third to get the city's name.
- All the data of the user is stored in a database and with that information the location is
  plotted on the map with the a pop-up which holds all the information with a time-stamp
